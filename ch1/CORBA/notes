Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) 
that enables software components written in multiple computer languages and running on multiple computers to work together.

CORBA is a standard for distributing objects across networks so that operations on those objects can be called remotely. 
CORBA is not associated with a particular programming language, 
and any language with a CORBA binding can be used to call and implement CORBA objects. 
Objects are described in a syntax called Interface Definition Language (IDL).

It consist of 2 system 
1 -> client
